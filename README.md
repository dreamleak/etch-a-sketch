# Etch-A-Sketch

Focusing more on DOM manipulation is just what I needed for extra practice to become familiarized with Javascript's tediously useful properities. I appreciate that this project has given me a chance to finally put CSS grid to use for setting up the canvas for my grid container, providing another topic to dissect upon. Creating HTML elements through vanilla Javascript also proves handy as I use Developer Tools to witness my dynamically implemented divs (and iterating each div to appear as rows and columns, instead of line-by-line), for example. In addition, researching and learning about other event listeners such as mouseover and mouseout are highly practical for firing cursor hovering effects. 

Attentively, taking a glimpse at bubbling is quite impressive when having CSS styling applied through the same method. DOM Manipulation is certainly versatile, and innovatively keeps code DRY (so I've noticed).
